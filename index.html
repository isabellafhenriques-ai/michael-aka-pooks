  Hi Michael :)<br><br>

  Apologies in advance for the probably awful code<br>
  and even worse terminology.<br><br>

  A very brief crash course, a few distant memories<br>
  from taking CAT in high school, and a great amount<br>
  of patience and love went into making this.<br><br>

  If nothing else, I hope you can see the effort.<br>
  Or at least get a good laugh out of it.<br><br>

  Love,<br>
  Bella

  <p class="comment">
    This is me trying to enter your world —  
    a version of it I don’t fully understand yet,  
    but one I wanted to meet you in anyway.
  </p>

  <p class="comment">
    Thank you for being patient with me,
    for laughing with me,
    and for being someone I feel safe choosing.
