  <!-- 
    Hi Michael :)

    If you’re reading this, I’m really glad you knew exactly
    where to look. That feels very on brand for you.

    Apologies/ apologies in advance (depending on when you
    realised to look here) for the probably awful code
    and even worse terminology.
    A very brief crash course, a few distant memories
    from taking CAT in high school, and a great amount
    of patience and love went into making this.

    This little message lives here because it felt right.
    Quiet. Intentional. Not meant for everyone.
    Just for you.

    Thank you for letting me step into your world,
    even when I don’t fully understand it yet.
    Thank you for your patience, your laughter,
    and the way you make space for me to learn
    without ever making me feel small.

    In many ways, you light my life —
    not loudly, not dramatically,
    but steadily.
    You make things feel safe.
    You make trust feel possible.
    You make me want to stay.

    If nothing else, I hope you can see the effort.
    And if you’re smiling right now or even laughing at this,
    that’s more than enough for me.

    Love,
    Bella

    This is me trying to enter your world —  
    a version of it I don’t fully understand yet,  
    but one I wanted to meet you in anyway.
