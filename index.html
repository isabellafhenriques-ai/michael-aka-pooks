  <!-- 
    Hi Michael :)
    Apologies in advance for the probably awful code
    and even worse terminology.
    A very brief crash course, a few distant memories
    from taking CAT in high school, and a great amount
    of patience and love went into making this.
    
    If nothing else, I hope you can see the effort.
    Or at least get a good laugh out of it.
    
    Love,
    Bella

  <p class="comment">
    This is me trying to enter your world —  
    a version of it I don’t fully understand yet,  
    but one I wanted to meet you in anyway.
  </p>

  <p class="comment">
    Thank you for being patient with me,
    for laughing with me,
    and for being someone I feel safe choosing.
